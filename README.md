## Why?

When AI agents build your product, things can go wrong silently:
- **Hallucination** — agent makes up data or ignores constraints
- **Regression** — new feature breaks old ones
- **Context loss** — agent forgets decisions from 3 conversations ago
- **Drift** — code diverges from design, docs fall behind
- **Silent failure** — contracts between services break without error

KFSP Skill Set provides **5 layers of protection** that catch these problems across **4 interaction surfaces** (user-facing, backend, third-party services, internal components).

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
# Clone or download
git clone https://github.com/nguyenthanhcllhp/kfsp-skill-set.git

# Copy commands to your project's Claude config
cp -r kfsp-skill-set/commands/kfsp/ \
  ~/.claude/projects/<your-project-hash>/commands/kfsp/

# Or install globally (available in all projects)
cp -r kfsp-skill-set/commands/kfsp/ \
  ~/.claude/commands/kfsp/
```

### 2. Initialize

```bash
# In Claude Code:
/kfsp:dev-journal --init    # Start your developer journal
/kfsp:doc-pilot --status    # Baseline your documentation
/kfsp:help                  # See all commands
```

### 3. Develop!

```bash
/kfsp:pre-mortem "Add user authentication"   # Forecast risks
# ... write code ...
/kfsp:pre-commit                              # Validate before commit
/kfsp:sweep auth_controller.dart              # Check blast radius
/kfsp:doc-pilot --what-changed auth           # Update docs
```

## All 13 Skills

### T5 🎯 Business Impact + T4 👤 User Experience

| Skill | What it does | When to use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `/kfsp:product-health` | **NEW** PM's comprehensive dashboard: 8 dimensions (UX, Tech, Docs, Business, Legal, Ops, Data, Growth). Score /80 with gap analysis. | Monthly or before major launch |
| `/kfsp:doc-pilot` | Tracks which docs need updating. Knows what info goes into which file. Ensures user guide is ready before store submission. | After every feature change |
| `/kfsp:pre-mortem` | Before building anything, imagines it already failed. Identifies risks across all 4 interaction surfaces. Produces Go/No-Go decision. | Before starting new feature |
| `/kfsp:ux-audit` | **NEW** UX evaluation using Nielsen 10 heuristics + accessibility + user flow analysis. Designed for PMs with no UX background. Templates included. | After building screens, before release |
| `/kfsp:ux-parity` | Compares actual UI against design specs. Finds hardcoded colors, wrong spacing, typography drift. | After building screens |

### T3 🧪 Quality Assurance

| Skill | What it does | When to use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `/kfsp:surface-test` | Tests interaction contracts across 4 surfaces: user↔app, app↔backend, app↔services, component↔component. | Before releases |
| `/kfsp:sentinel` | Takes baseline snapshot before changes, compares after. Detects regressions in files, routes, providers, tokens. | Before/after refactoring |
| `/kfsp:release-gate` | 10 comprehensive gates (build, security, design, UX, tests, deps, surfaces, docs, store, rollback). Scores /100 with Go/No-Go. | Before submitting to store |

### T2 🔧 Code Integrity

| Skill | What it does | When to use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `/kfsp:sweep` | Analyzes blast radius after code changes. Checks design tokens, routes, providers, widgets, tests, docs. | After every code change |
| `/kfsp:pre-commit` | Validates code before commit: no hardcoded values, no secrets, no broken imports, file size limits. | Before every commit |
| `/kfsp:sync-check` | Verifies all source copies are in sync, docs match code reality. | Weekly or before handoff |
| `/kfsp:post-phase` | Post-milestone checklist: update docs, sync sources, run regression, archive artifacts. | After completing a phase |

### T1 🛡️ Agent Safety

| Skill | What it does | When to use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `/kfsp:guard` | Continuous guardian. Checks structural integrity, design system fidelity, cross-cutting concerns, spec alignment, agent safety. Health score /100. | After agent runs any task |
| `/kfsp:dev-journal` | Developer journal — records decisions, incidents, learnings as "precedents" (like case law). Searchable by future agents/humans. | After every important decision |
| `/kfsp:incident-review` | Post-incident analysis: timeline, 5 Whys root cause, blast radius on 4 surfaces, prevention plan, skill updates needed. | After any bug or crash |

### Utility

## The 4 Interaction Surfaces

Every app interacts in 4 directions. KFSP skills monitor all of them:

```
                    ┌──────────────┐
                    │ 🔵 FRONT     │
                    │ User ↔ App   │
                    └──────┬───────┘
                           │
      ┌────────────────────┼────────────────────┐
      │                    │                    │
┌─────┴──────┐    ┌────────┴───────┐   ┌───────┴──────┐
│ 🟡 LATERAL │    │  🟢 INTERNAL   │   │ 🟡 LATERAL   │
│ 3rd Party  │    │  Component ↔   │   │ Analytics    │
│ Services   │    │  Component     │   │ Monitoring   │
└────────────┘    └────────┬───────┘   └──────────────┘
                           │
                    ┌──────┴───────┐
                    │ 🔴 BACK      │
                    │ App ↔ Server │
                    └──────────────┘
```

Each surface has **contracts** (expected behavior), **standards** (thresholds), **monitors** (continuous checks), and **tests** (verification).

See `references/INTERACTION_SURFACE_MAP.md` for the complete map with 36 interaction types.

## Workflows

### Frequency Pyramid

Run the most frequent checks fastest:

```
Every commit (~30s):      /kfsp:pre-commit
Every change (~2min):     /kfsp:sweep
Every feature (~5min):    /kfsp:pre-mortem → dev → /kfsp:ux-parity
Every phase (~10min):     /kfsp:post-phase → /kfsp:doc-pilot
Every release (~15min):   /kfsp:release-gate → /kfsp:surface-test
On demand:                /kfsp:incident-review, /kfsp:dev-journal
Weekly:                   /kfsp:guard --deep
```

### Chain Workflows

**New Feature:**
```
pre-mortem → [develop] → sweep → ux-parity → doc-pilot --what-changed → dev-journal --log decision
```

**Bug Fix:**
```
[fix] → sweep → pre-commit → commit → dev-journal --log incident
```

**Release:**
```
sentinel --baseline → [develop] → sentinel --compare → release-gate → surface-test all → doc-pilot --checklist
```

**Agent Autonomous:**
```
[agent task] → guard → if OK continue, if FAIL → stop + incident-review
```

## Companion Tools (Recommended)

KFSP Skill Set works standalone, but is designed to pair with:

### 🔧 GSD (Get Shit Done) — Planning & Execution Framework

> Spec-driven development: plan → tasks → execute → verify

- **What:** 33 commands for project planning, phase management, and atomic execution
- **Why pair:** GSD handles *what to build*, KFSP skills ensure *it's built safely*
- **Install:** See [GSD GitHub](https://github.com/get-shit-done/gsd) or check if pre-installed:
  ```bash
  # Test if GSD is available:
  /gsd:help
  ```
- **Key commands:** `/gsd:new-project`, `/gsd:plan-phase`, `/gsd:execute-phase`, `/gsd:verify-work`

### 🔄 Ralph Loop — Autonomous Iteration

> AI runs in a loop until task is done. Git is memory between loops.

- **What:** Continuous self-referential AI loops with monitoring dashboard
- **Why pair:** Ralph handles *autonomous execution*, KFSP guard verifies after each loop
- **Install:** See [Ralph Loop](https://github.com/anthropics/ralph-loop) or:
  ```bash
  # Test if Ralph is available:
  /ralph-loop --help
  ```
- **Key commands:** `ralph --monitor`, `ralph-enable`

### 🦋 Domain Skills (Optional)

Add domain-specific skills based on your tech stack:

| Tech | Skill | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| Flutter | `flutter-patterns`, `flutter-development` | Built-in or custom |
| React Native | `react-native-patterns` | Custom |
| Next.js | `nextjs-patterns` | Community |
| Python | `python-patterns` | Community |

### Combined Workflow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PLAN  │  GSD: /gsd:plan-phase              │
│        │  KFSP: /kfsp:pre-mortem            │
├────────┼────────────────────────────────────┤
│  BUILD │  GSD: /gsd:execute-phase           │
│   or   │  KFSP: /kfsp:pre-commit (each)    │
│  Ralph │  Ralph: ralph --monitor            │
│        │  KFSP: /kfsp:guard (each loop)     │
├────────┼────────────────────────────────────┤
│ VERIFY │  GSD: /gsd:verify-work             │
│        │  KFSP: /kfsp:release-gate          │
│        │  KFSP: /kfsp:surface-test all      │
│        │  KFSP: /kfsp:doc-pilot --checklist │
└────────┴────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Adapting for Your Project

KFSP skills are designed to be project-agnostic. To adapt:

### 1. Source Path Detection

Every skill auto-detects your source code location. Edit the path list in each skill:

```bash
# Default (KFSP Flutter):
for path in "/tmp/kfsp_flutter" "$HOME/Desktop/kfsp_flutter" "Product/source"; do
  [ -d "$path/lib" ] && SOURCE="$path" && break
done

# Your project (e.g., React Native):
for path in "./src" "../app/src" "$HOME/projects/myapp/src"; do
  [ -d "$path" ] && SOURCE="$path" && break
done
```

### 2. Design Token Paths

Edit `ux-parity.md` to point to your design token files:

```bash
# KFSP Flutter:
COLORS="lib/core/theme/kfsp_colors.dart"

# Your project:
COLORS="src/styles/colors.ts"  # or tailwind.config.js, etc.
```

### 3. Doc Registry

Edit `doc-pilot.md` to map your documentation structure:

```markdown
# Your project's doc mapping:
| Change | Write to |
|--------|----------|
| API change | docs/api-spec.md |
| UI change | docs/components.md |
| Feature done | CHANGELOG.md |
```

### 4. Feature List

Edit `guard.md` expected folder structure to match your project.

### Skills That Work Without Changes

These skills are already project-agnostic:
- `pre-mortem` — risk analysis framework (universal)
- `dev-journal` — journal system (universal)
- `incident-review` — post-mortem template (universal)
- `sentinel` — file/route/provider diffing (universal)
- `release-gate` — release checklist (universal)

## For Agent Teams / Swarms

KFSP Skill Set is specifically designed for AI agent safety:

| Problem | How KFSP Solves It |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Hallucination** | `guard` verifies every change against real codebase |
| **Context loss** | `dev-journal` stores precedents, searchable by new agents |
| **Scope creep** | `pre-mortem` defines scope, `guard` enforces it |
| **Regression** | `sentinel` snapshots before/after, `sweep` traces blast radius |
| **Design drift** | `ux-parity` checks tokens, `sync-check` verifies copies |
| **Silent failures** | `surface-test` validates contracts on all 4 surfaces |
| **Missing docs** | `doc-pilot` auto-reminds and maps info → document |
| **No learning** | `dev-journal` records, `incident-review` analyzes patterns |
| **Loss of control** | 5-tier model + `guard` after every agent task |

### Agent Swarm Setup

```bash
# Each agent in the swarm should:
1. Read /kfsp:help on startup → understand available protections
2. Run /kfsp:guard after every task → verify safety
3. Log decisions via /kfsp:dev-journal --log decision → preserve context
4. Search journal via /kfsp:dev-journal --search <topic> → leverage precedents
```

## Disclaimer

**This skill set is NOT created by a domain expert.** It is distilled from personal thinking, experience, and intuition of a non-tech Product Manager building a real product with AI. The ideas, checklists, and frameworks here are generalized from a Vietnamese stock analysis app — if something feels unfamiliar, try asking AI to translate/adapt it to your context rather than forcing interpretation.

**You are fully responsible for your own actions.** Whether you use these skills, modify them, or ignore them — every decision and its consequences belong to the person who acts. This includes me, the creator, who has been and will always be accountable for my own actions regardless of what tools, skills, or references I consulted beforehand.

**This is a snapshot of work-in-progress.** This version was published while the project is still mid-development — packaged to preserve a "trail of thoughts" that were getting messy and needed structure. Skills will be updated as the product evolves. If updates seem slow, I'm probably working on another domain (check my other repos). If my GitHub goes quiet entirely — well, I've chosen peace and happiness, and that's fine too. 🙏
